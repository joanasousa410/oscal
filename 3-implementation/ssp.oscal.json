Upon receiving a request, the web server validates the request and forwards it to the appropriate service within the SignServer application. The application then interacts with the PostgreSQL database to retrieve or store relevant data. For cryptographic operations, the application communicates with the nCipher nShield HSM to ensure secure key management and operation execution. Once the digital signature or timestamp is generated, the result is sent back to the client through the secure API endpoint. The entire process is logged in the audit logs, which are also stored in the PostgreSQL database for traceability and compliance purposes."
